<h2>Phong Lighting</h2>
<p>In case you're not all up to speed on the theory, here's a quick recap of the most important bits.</p>

<p>
    Phong Lighting approximates the color intensity of a point in space based on multiple parameters allowing for shiny and matte surface materials to be displayed. <br />
    It can be implemented in the vertex shader to be calculated per vertex or in the fragment shader to be calculated per fragment to avoid visual artifacts. <br />
    The following vectors are relevant for the calculation:

    It is important to note the direction of the vectors and they must all be normalized and be transformed into the same coordinate system/space. <br />
    The lighting model uses the following equation:

    The sum can be implemented by looping over the light sources and adding up the diffuse and specular parts for each. <br />
