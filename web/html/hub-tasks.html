    Finally you are here! <br />
    The evil DEVILoper has stolen our graphics features and holy orbs.<br />
    It looks like one was left here.
    The other orbs are scattered across the world and you must bring them back!
    <ol>
        <li>Place the orbs on the pedestal to open the gates.</li>
        <li>Walk through them to get to other areas.</li>
        <li>Repair graphics features in each area to master the challenges.</li>
    </ol>

    Thank you for bringing all the orbs back! <br />
    This is the Deviloper and he is in fact just... the Developer. <br />
    <br />
    He actually did not steal the orbs and graphics features. <br/ >
    If this world and its challenges seemed just a little too conveniently set up to teach specific topics... well obiously it was all created to do exactly that. <br />
    <br />
    Congratulations! <br />
    We hope you had fun learning!
