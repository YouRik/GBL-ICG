    Thank you for bringing all the orbs back! <br />
    This is the Deviloper and he is in fact just... the Developer. <br />
    <br />
    He actually did not steal the orbs and graphics features. <br/ >
    If this world and its challenges seemed just a little too conveniently set up to teach specific topics... well obiously it was all created to do exactly that. <br />
    <br />
    Congratulations! <br />
    We hope you had fun learning!
