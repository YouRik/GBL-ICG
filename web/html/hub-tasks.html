    Finally you are here! <br />
    The evil DEVILoper wanted to steal our magic orbs but in doing that, he broke our graphics features and scattered the orbs all across the world! <br />
    I was able to protect one of them. <br />
    You must bring back the orbs before the DEVILoper finds them!
    <ol>
        <li>Place the orbs on the pedestal to open the gates.</li>
        <li>Walk through the gates to get to other areas.</li>
        <li>Repair graphics features in each area to master the challenges.</li>
    </ol>

<div id="task1">
    Give me the big orb and I will tell you the truth!

    I, the DEVILoper am in fact just... the developer of this world. <br />
    Thank you for bringing the orbs back. <br />
    <br />
    If this world and its challenges seemed a little too conveniently set up to teach specific topics... well obviously I created all of this to do exactly that. <br />
    <br />
    Congratulations! <br />
    We hope you had fun learning!
