<h2>Spline Curves</h2>
<p>In case you're not all up to speed on the theory, here's a quick recap of the most important bits.</p>
<p>
    Bezi&eacute;r curves are defined by at least 3 control points where the start and end point are exact and the others are approximated. <br />
    De Casteljau's algorithm can be used to approximate curve segments. Mathematically, the following recursive equation describes the process:
